Additional bugs found during continued E2E testing. Please fix and confirm.

### CRITICAL

**BUG R6 — False "network error / check your connection" when starting a hail trip**
Driver gets a network error popup when starting a hail trip even with full connectivity.
Root cause: the app calls `POST /api/job/create` to get a job ID at trip start. If that call fails or times out, the error shown is a generic "check connection" message even when the device has internet.
Fix:
- Retry the `/api/job/create` call 3× before giving up
- Only show "check connection" if the device genuinely has no internet (check `navigator.onLine` or equivalent)
- If the SA portal returns an error, show the actual error, not a connection message

**BUG R7 — Meter stops working if network drops mid-trip**
If connectivity drops during a hail trip, the meter stops. Driver cannot complete the trip.
Required behaviour: the meter must run entirely on-device (local timer + GPS). Network is only needed at trip END to submit the completed record. The meter must never depend on Firebase or any network call to keep running.
Fix: decouple meter logic from all network writes. Run meter with a local interval timer. GPS tracking stored locally. Only write to Firebase when the trip ends.

**BUG R8 — Completed offline trips not uploading after reconnection**
Trips completed while offline are not syncing to Firebase when the driver reconnects. Firebase shows no record of these trips at all — they are stuck on the device.
Fix: write completed trip to local storage first, then attempt Firebase write. On reconnect, flush the local queue. Show driver a "syncing..." indicator while uploading. Retry up to 3 times on failure, then alert driver if sync still fails.

**BUG R10 — TM tariff not resetting between trips**
Three consecutive Driver 2 trips all recorded `tariffId: "5"` (Total Mobility tariff) regardless of payment type — including cash hail trips and a food delivery. The tariff from one trip carries over to the next.
Firebase evidence: `hail-1778049377344` (cash food), `hail-1778047760181` (TM), `hail-1778046818612` (cash hail) — all show `tariffId: "5"`.
Fix: always reset tariff to the company default taxi tariff when a new hail trip is started. Never carry tariff state between trips.

**BUG R11 — Card payment not working in driver app hail flow**
When passenger selects card payment at end of hail trip, payment does not process.
SA portal Stripe keys are confirmed set. To collect card payment:
- Call `GET /api/payment-config?cid={companyId}` on the SA portal to get the Stripe publishable key
- Use Stripe SDK with that key to collect card details and confirm payment
- Write `cardPayment: true`, `paymentMethod: "card"` to the completed trip record

### HIGH

**BUG R4 (updated) — Double messages + messages not writing to driverMsg/{companyId}**
Firebase shows `driverMsg/620611` is null — driver app is NOT writing to `driverMsg/{companyId}` at all.
Instead, messages are being written to BOTH `notification/D002` AND `notification/TAXI02`.
The backward-compat relay then copies D002 → TAXI02, so dispatch sees every message twice.
Fix:
- Write driver messages ONLY to `driverMsg/{companyId}` (e.g. `driverMsg/620611`)
- Include fields: `from`, `driverId`, `vehicleId`, `senderName`, `text`, `timestamp`
- Remove all message writes from `notification/` — that path is for incoming job offers only

### MEDIUM

**BUG R9 — Food job incorrectly available as hail**
Driver completed a food delivery as a hail trip (`bookingType: "food"`, `source: "hail"`). Food jobs must only come through dispatch. Hail is always taxi only.
Fix: remove food and freight from the hail job type selector. Hail = taxi only, always.

## BookaWaka E2E Test — Owner Portal Bug Report (2026-05-06)

These bugs were found during a solo end-to-end test run. Please fix and confirm when done.

### HIGH — Security

**BUG 1 — Driver passwords stored in plain text**
Driver passwords created via the Owner Portal are stored in plain text in Firebase. This is a serious security issue.
Fix: hash passwords before storing (SHA-256 minimum, bcrypt preferred). The SA portal already uses SHA-256 for its own portal passwords as a reference.

**BUG 2 — Driver creation form blocks with "fill in all required fields" even when all fields are filled**
The form validates ALL tabs on save, including the EID / National ID field. In NZ, this field is not used and drivers don't have an EID. This makes it impossible to create a driver via the form without entering a dummy value.
Fix: make the EID / National ID field optional (not required) when the company's country is NZ. Or make it optional globally.

**BUG 3 — Vehicle field name mismatch with driver app**
When saving a driver with an assigned vehicle, the Owner Portal writes:
- `allocatedVehicles: {"Taxi02": true}` (object)
- `allocatedTaxi: "Taxi02"`

The driver app reads:
- `assignedVehicles: ["Taxi02"]` (array)
- `vehicleId: "TAXI02"` (uppercase string)

Result: drivers created via Owner Portal show "No vehicles available" in the driver app.
Fix: write `assignedVehicles: [vehicleId]` and `vehicleId: vehicleId.toUpperCase()` when saving a driver. Keep `allocatedVehicles` as well for backward compat if needed.

### HIGH — Data

**BUG 4 — Full data missing in closed job reports**
Completed job reports (both hail and dispatch) are missing trip data: fare, distance, duration, payment type, driver name, passenger info.
Firebase paths: `completedJobs/{cid}/{bookingId}` (hail), `allbookings/{cid}/{bookingId}` (dispatch)
Key fields to display: `fare`, `distanceKm`, `durationLabel`, `paymentType`, `driverId`, `driverName`, `pickupAddress`, `dropAddress`, `completedAt_ISO`

**BUG 5 — Driver trip history showing wrong or missing data**
The driver trip history panel in the Owner Portal is not showing the correct completed trips for drivers.
Fix: read from `completedJobs/{cid}` filtered by `driverId`, and also from `allbookings/{cid}` filtered by `driverId` and `status: 'Completed'`.

---

### LOW

**BUG 6 — Duplicate driver ID (dispatcherId) not enforced**
The uniqueness check for driver ID / dispatcherId does not catch all duplicates, allowing two drivers to have the same ID.
Fix: when saving a new driver, query all existing drivers for the company and confirm the `dispatcherId` / `id` field is unique before saving.

### Owner Portal — Firebase field contract reminders
- Driver record path: `drivers/{cid}/{uid}` (nested, NOT flat push key)
- Required driver fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `companyId`, `id` (dispatcherId), `systemEmail`, `assignedVehicles` (array), `vehicleId` (uppercase), `active`, `status`, `allowedServices`, `uid`
- Vehicle assignment: also update the vehicle record at `vehicles/{pushKey}` → set `assignedDriver`, `assignedDriverKey`
- Cash toggle: hide cash if EITHER `bwConfig/paymentMethods/cashEnabled` OR `companySettings/{cid}/paymentMethods/cashEnabled` is false
- Driver ratings: `driverRatings/{cid}/{bookingId}` — universal path for all job types

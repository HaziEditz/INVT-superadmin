## BookaWaka E2E Test — Dispatch App Bug Report (2026-05-06)

These bugs were found during a solo end-to-end test run. Please fix and confirm when done.

---

### CRITICAL

**BUG 1 — Dispatch jobs not reaching the driver app**
Jobs created in the dispatch app sit at `Status: Pending` in Firebase and are never delivered to the driver app as an offer. The driver app never shows the incoming job offer popup.
Firebase path: `allbookings/{cid}/{bookingId}` — Status stays "Pending", AssignedDriver stays blank.
Fix: check the offer push/listener pipeline between dispatch and driver app.

---

### HIGH

**BUG 2 — Scheduled (later) jobs not dispatching at the correct time**
Jobs scheduled for a future pickup time are not being automatically dispatched to drivers at the pre-dispatch window before pickup.
Fix: verify the scheduled dispatch timer/cron is running and correctly watching `allbookings/{cid}` for upcoming jobs.

**BUG 3 — Creating or editing a scheduled job fails**
Attempting to create or update a job with a future scheduled time does not save the job — no record appears in Firebase.
Fix: check the job creation flow for scheduled bookings; confirm `POST /api/job/create` is being called and the response job ID is being used.

**BUG 4 — Driver-to-dispatch messages not showing**
Messages sent by the driver to dispatch are not appearing in the dispatch app.
Fix: check the Firebase listener path for driver messages.

**BUG 5 — Closed job detail missing data**
When viewing a completed job in the dispatch app, the trip detail panel is missing: route map, fare, distance, duration, driver info, passenger info.
Firebase paths to read: `allbookings/{cid}/{bookingId}` and `completedJobs/{cid}/{bookingId}`

**BUG 6 — Two taxis showing in fleet when one is inactive**
The dispatch fleet view is showing both Taxi01 (status: inactive) and Taxi02 (status: active). Only active vehicles should appear in the dispatch view.
Fix: filter vehicles by `status === 'active'` when loading the fleet list.

### MEDIUM

**BUG 7 — Payment flow — dispatch should require pre-payment for web bookings**
Web bookings should require payment before the job is dispatched (no pay-on-arrival). Currently jobs from the web booking site are dispatched without any payment being collected first.
Fix: check the `paymentStatus` or `prepaid` field on the booking before offering it to drivers. Web bookings should be held until payment is confirmed.

### Dispatch app — Firebase field contract reminders
- Job record path: `allbookings/{cid}/{bookingId}` — use `Status` (capital S) field
- Driver GPS: read from `online/{cid}/{vid}/current` → `{lat, lng, hasGps, time}` (lat/lng are under `current` child, not top-level)
- Session revoke: listen to `superClients/{cid}/sessionRevoke` — force sign-out if `sessionRevoke > loginTimestamp`
- vehicleId and companyId must be included in every job payload written to `jobDetails/{cid}/{bookingId}`
- All job IDs must come from `POST /api/job/create` — no local ID generation

# Wire SA Stripe Webhook to Dispatch /api/payment/confirm

## What & Why
When a web booking payment completes, Stripe fires a webhook to the SA portal. Currently the SA portal's webhook handler writes directly to Firebase `pendingjobs` by spreading the raw `allbookings` record. The dispatch server now has a dedicated `POST /api/payment/confirm` endpoint that correctly updates its in-memory `jobStore` (lifting the payment gate) and writes a schema-complete `pendingjobs` record. The SA portal must call this endpoint instead of doing the Firebase write itself, otherwise the dispatch system never picks up the job.

There is also a secondary issue observed in testing: the Stripe webhook did not arrive at the SA portal at all for a live test booking. This must be investigated as part of this task — if the webhook URL registered in Stripe is wrong or pointing elsewhere, the code change alone will not fix the problem.

## Done looks like
- A web booking payment triggers the SA portal's Stripe webhook (`POST /api/stripe/webhook`)
- The handler calls the dispatch server's `POST /api/payment/confirm` with the correct `X-Admin-Key` header and a numeric `companyId`
- The dispatch system picks up the job and assigns a driver as expected
- The direct Firebase `pendingjobs` spread in the SA portal webhook is removed or replaced by the dispatch call
- If the webhook was not arriving (wrong Stripe URL), the correct webhook URL is identified and documented so the Stripe dashboard can be updated

## Out of scope
- Changes to the dispatch server itself (already done by dispatch dev)
- Rental or towing Stripe flows
- Subscription invoice webhook handling

## Steps
1. **Audit Stripe webhook delivery** — Check the Stripe dashboard webhook logs (or add logging to the SA portal webhook handler) to confirm whether the `booking_payment` webhook is being delivered to the SA portal URL. Identify if the registered webhook URL is correct and document the expected URL.

2. **Replace pendingjobs spread with dispatch API call** — In the `booking_payment` branch of the SA portal's Stripe webhook handler, remove the direct Firebase `pendingjobs` write. Replace it with an HTTP POST to the dispatch server's `/api/payment/confirm` endpoint, passing `X-Admin-Key` in the header and a numeric `companyId` in the body along with the booking details (`bookingId`, `cid`, `stripeSessionId`, etc.).

3. **Keep allbookings update in place** — The existing write to `allbookings/{cid}/{bookingId}` (patching `paymentStatus: 'paid'`, `Status: 'Pending'`) should remain — only the `pendingjobs` spread is being replaced.

4. **Add error handling and logging** — If the dispatch API call fails (network error, non-2xx), log the error with the booking ID and fall back gracefully (do not crash the webhook handler). Log success with the booking ID for traceability.

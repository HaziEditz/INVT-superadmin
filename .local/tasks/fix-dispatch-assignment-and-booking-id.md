# Fix Dispatch Assignment & Booking ID Format

## What & Why

Two bugs reported by the operator:

**Bug 1 — Dispatch: car shows Available but cannot be sent to a job.**
When a booking comes in from the website, it lands in `pendingjobs/{cid}/{bookingId}`. The dispatch console sees the job in its queue but when the dispatcher tries to assign/send an available car, the assignment appears to go through on the dispatch side yet the job is never actually marked Assigned and no notification reaches the driver. Investigation points to the `pendingjobs` record written by the Stripe webhook (`src/routes/stripe.ts`) copying the full `allbookings` record — which uses a different field schema than what the dispatcher's `_normFbJob()` / `_doSend()` pipeline expects. Specifically, the record is missing or has wrong-cased versions of `BookingSource`, `PaymentMethod`, `Status`, `PickAddress`/`DropAddress`, and the `WebBooking: true` flag. The dispatcher's auto-dispatch and manual-send filters may silently skip the job or fail to build the notification payload correctly, leaving the car "Available" and the job stuck in the queue with no assignment recorded.

Additionally, the normalizer marks `pendingjobs` jobs as `Assigned` status after dispatch writes to `rideStatus`, but if the `pendingjobs` record is never cleaned up after a successful assignment (because `rideStatus` write never happened due to the broken payload), the stale-pending-jobs normalizer won't clean it either (it only acts on `status === 'assigned'` records that have a completed/cancelled `rideStatus`).

**Bug 2 — Booking ID shows full company name instead of 3-digit suffix.**
The `generateJobId()` function in `src/jobId.ts` correctly uses `cid.slice(-3)` (last 3 digits of the company ID). However, if the web booking site passes the full company *name* string (e.g. `"Auckland Cabs"`) instead of the numeric company *ID* as `companyId`, `cid.slice(-3)` produces `"abs"` — three letters from the company name — and the regex check `/^\d{9,}$/` in `syncOfflineTrip` then rejects the resulting ID. The fix is to validate that `companyId` is numeric in `generateJobId` and throw clearly if not, and to audit the Stripe webhook + `pendingjobs` write path to ensure `companyId` (not `companyName`) is always used.

## Done looks like

- A web booking that comes in from the website can be assigned to an available car in the dispatch console without getting stuck — the job is marked Assigned, the driver receives the notification, and `rideStatus` is written correctly.
- Booking IDs generated from website bookings are purely numeric (e.g. `34526050842`), not containing letters from a company name.
- The `syncOfflineTrip` endpoint no longer rejects valid booking IDs from web-sourced trips.
- The normalizer's stale-pending-jobs cleaner handles edge cases where the dispatcher successfully wrote `rideStatus` but `pendingjobs` was not cleaned up.

## Out of scope

- Changes to the dispatcher app itself (separate codebase — this plan only covers the SA portal server-side and the `pendingjobs` record schema).
- Fixing auto-dispatch logic in the dispatcher (that is a dispatcher-side concern).
- Any changes to how the driver app processes notifications.

## Steps

1. **Validate `companyId` in `generateJobId`** — In `src/jobId.ts`, add a guard at the top of `generateJobId` that throws a clear error if `companyId` is not a numeric string (i.e. `/^\d+$/` fails). Log the bad value so it surfaces in server logs.

2. **Audit the Stripe webhook `pendingjobs` write** — In `src/routes/stripe.ts`, after Stripe confirms `booking_payment`, the code does a spread of the raw `allbookings` record into `pendingjobs`. Ensure the written record explicitly includes the fields the dispatcher pipeline needs: `BookingSource: 'Website'`, `WebBooking: true`, `paymentStatus: 'paid'`, `paymentMethod: 'card'`, `Status: 'Pending'`, `status: 'pending'`, and that `PickAddress`/`DropAddress` are correctly mapped from `pickupLocation.address`/`dropoffLocation.address` if the top-level fields are absent. Also confirm `companyId` (not `companyName`) is in the record.

3. **Normalizer: broaden stale-pending-jobs cleanup** — In `src/normalizer.ts`, the `normalizeStalePendingJobs` function currently only acts on records where `jobStatus === 'assigned'`. Extend it to also clean up records where `jobStatus === 'pending'` but `rideStatus` already shows `completed` or `cancelled` — these are stuck jobs that the dispatcher successfully finished but never cleared from `pendingjobs`.

4. **Add a `pendingjobs` schema normalizer pass** — In `src/normalizer.ts`, add a new normalization step that checks every `pendingjobs` record for missing dispatcher-required fields (`PickAddress`, `DropAddress`, `BookingSource`, `WebBooking`) and patches them in from the corresponding `allbookings` record if found. This acts as a safety net so any future schema gaps are auto-healed within 30 seconds.

5. **Log and surface job ID validation errors** — In `src/routes/jobs.ts` `POST /api/job/create`, if `companyId` fails the numeric check (delegated to `generateJobId`), return a clear `400` error that includes the received `companyId` value. This makes the web-booking-site misconfiguration immediately visible in logs rather than silently producing broken IDs.
